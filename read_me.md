the sort branch contains two folders, sort and test. In the sort ones there is a list of sorting functions:

- bubble sort
- insert sort
- merge sort
- quick sort

In the test folder there are tests for each of the sorting function. Sort functions are imported from the all_sort.py file

In order to run the tests you need to be in a vir env and use pytest as:
-  pytest test/ (it'll run all the tests at once)
-  pytest test/quick_test.py (to run a specific test)
